 * Quicksort

Quicksort is a fast sorting algorithm, which is used not only for educational purposes, 
* but widely applied in practice. On the average, it has O(n log n) complexity, 
* making quicksort suitable for sorting big data volumes. 
* The idea of the algorithm is quite simple and once you realize it, you can write quicksort as fast as bubble sort.

Algorithm

The divide-and-conquer strategy is used in quicksort. Below the recursion step is described:
Choose a pivot value. We take the value of the middle element as pivot value, but it can be any value, 
* which is in range of sorted values, even if it doesn't present in the array.
Partition. Rearrange elements in such a way, 
* that all elements which are lesser than the pivot go to the left part of the array and all elements greater than the pivot,
* go to the right part of the array. Values equal to the pivot can stay in any part of the array. 
* Notice, that array may be divided in non-equal parts.
Sort both parts. Apply quicksort algorithm recursively to the left and the right parts.
Partition algorithm in detail

There are two indices i and j and at the very beginning of the partition algorithm i points to the first element 
* in the array and j points to the last one. Then algorithm moves i forward, 
* until an element with value greater or equal to the pivot is found. Index j is moved backward, 
* until an element with value lesser or equal to the pivot is found. If i â‰¤ j then they are swapped and i steps to the next position (i + 1), 
* j steps to the previous one (j - 1). Algorithm stops, when i becomes greater than j.

After partition, all values before i-th element are less or equal than the pivot and all values after j-th element are greater or equal to the pivot.
